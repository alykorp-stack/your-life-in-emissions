# Population - Data package

This data package contains the data that powers the chart ["Population"](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population?v=1&csvType=full&useColumnShortNames=false) on the Our World in Data website. It was downloaded on October 14, 2026.

### Active Filters

A filtered subset of the full data was downloaded. The following filters were applied:

## CSV structure

Each row is an observation for an entity (usually a country or region) at a timepoint.

- "Entity" — the name of the entity, e.g. "United States".
- "Code" — our internal entity code. For most countries this is the [ISO alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) code, e.g. "USA"; historical and other non-standard entities get a custom code.
- "Year" or "Day" — the timepoint. Annual data has a "Year" column holding an integer year; otherwise a "Day" column holds a date string in the form "YYYY-MM-DD".
- The final column is the data column — the time series that powers the chart. Downloaded with the "full data" option it corresponds to the time series below; with "only selected data visible in the chart" it is transformed depending on the chart type, so the correspondence may be less direct.


## Metadata.json structure

The .metadata.json file contains metadata about the data package. The "charts" key contains information to recreate the chart, like the title, subtitle etc. The "columns" key contains information about each of the columns in the csv, like the unit, timespan covered, citation for the data etc.

## How we process data at Our World in Data

Our World in Data is almost never the original producer of the data - almost all of the data we use has been compiled by others. If you want to re-use data, it is your responsibility to ensure that you adhere to the sources' license and to credit them correctly. Please note that a single time series may have more than one source - e.g. when we stitch together data from different time periods by different producers or when we calculate per capita metrics using population data from a second source.

Preparing this data involves several processing steps. Depending on the data, this can include standardizing country names and world region definitions, converting units, calculating derived indicators such as per capita measures, as well as adding or adapting metadata such as the name or the description given to an indicator.

## Detailed information about the data


### Population
Population by country, available from 10,000 BCE to 2023, based on data and estimates from different sources.
Last updated: July 15, 2024  
Next expected update: December 2026  
Date range: 10000 BCE – 2023 CE  
Unit: people  
Source: HYDE (2023); Gapminder (2022); UN WPP (2024) – with major processing by Our World in Data  

#### How to cite this data

#### What you should know about this data
- Population is the most commonly used metric throughout Our World in Data. It is used directly to understand population growth over time, and indirectly to calculate per-capita indicators, making it easier to compare countries of different sizes.
- We construct this indicator by combining multiple sources covering different periods.
  - HYDE v3.3 (2023): historical estimates from 10,000 BCE to 1799.
  - Gapminder v7 (2022): for 1800-1949.
  - UN World Population Prospects (2024): for 1950 onwards, including 2100 projections.
  - Gapminder Systema Globalis (2023): additional source for former countries (Yugoslavia, USSR, etc.)
- Breaks in the data may occur at the boundaries between sources due to their methodological differences.
- You can read more about the sources and methodology in our [dedicated article](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources). We also provide a table of sources showing the source we use for each country-year.
- We calculate geographical aggregates (continents, income groups, etc.) by summing individual country populations. For years before 1800, we rely directly on HYDE's values for continents to ensure historical consistency.

#### Notes on our processing step for this indicator
### Combination of different sources
We construct our long-run population data by combining multiple sources:

- 10,000 BCE–1799: historical estimates by HYDE (v3.3).

- 1800–1949: historical estimates by Gapminder (v7).

- 1950–2023: population records from the United Nations World Population Prospects (2024 revision).

**Geographical aggregates**

- For most years, we calculate aggregates by summing the population of member countries.
- We do this based on [our definition of continents](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions#our-world-in-data) and the [World Bank’s income groups](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-bank-income-groups).
- The only exception is before 1800, where we use HYDE's estimates for continents (but not income groups).

For most of the years, we've estimated regional aggregates by summing the population of countries in each region. We've relied on [our continents](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions#our-world-in-data) and [World Bank income group definitions](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-bank-income-groups). The only exception is before 1800, where we've used HYDE's estimates on continents (but not income groups).

**World**
- Before 1800: we use data from HYDE.
- 1800-1950: we estimate the global population by summing all available countries in the dataset.
- After 1950, we rely on estimates from the United Nations World Population Prospects.

### PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency – History Database of the Global Environment

This database presents an update and expansion of the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE, v 3.3) and replaces former HYDE 3.2 version from 2017. HYDE is and internally consistent combination of updated historical population estimates and land use. Categories include cropland, with a new distinction into irrigated and rain fed crops (other than rice) and irrigated and rain fed rice. Also grazing lands are provided, divided into more intensively used pasture, converted rangeland and non-converted natural (less intensively used) rangeland. Population is represented by maps of total, urban, rural population and population density as well as built-up area. The period covered is 10 000 BCE to 2023 CE. Spatial resolution is 5 arc minutes (approx. 85 km2 at the equator), the files are in ESRI ASCII grid format.

### Gapminder – Population

Gapminder's population data is divided into two chunks: One long historical trend for the global population that goes back to 10,000 BC. And the second chunk is country estimates that only reaches back to 1800.

For the first chunk, several sources were used. You can learn more at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hkLbEilJbl630IG68q-aQJlUjuTFm9b_12nQMVd1sZM/edit#gid=0. For the second chunk, Gapminder uses UN population data between 1950 to 2100 from the UN Population Division World Population Prospects 2019, and the forecast to the year 2100 uses their medium-fertility variant.

For years before 1950, this version uses the data documented in greater detail by Mattias Lindgren in version 3. The main source was Angus Maddison's data, which CLIO Infra Project maintained and improved. Note that when combining version 3 with the new UN data, the trends for a few countries didn't match up in the overlapping year 1950.

Minor adjustments were made to the years before and after to smooth out discrepancies between the two sources and avoid spurious jumps in Gapminder's visualizations.
